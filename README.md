## 🚀 Overview

**Team Nicolucci Platform** is a comprehensive digital ecosystem designed for high-performance personal training. The project serves as both a high-conversion landing page and a robust web application (PWA) for managing student subscriptions and content.

It bridges the gap between marketing (sales) and delivery (member area), featuring a seamless checkout flow with recurring payments and an integrated e-commerce store.

- **Tiered Subscription System:** Dynamic pricing cards (Standard, Plus, Premium) with feature comparison.
- **E-commerce Module:** Integrated store for fitness gear and supplements.
- **Recurring Billing:** Automated monthly checkout flow for subscription renewal.
- **News Feed:** Content management system for team updates and fitness tips.

### 🔐 Member Area (Dashboard)
- **Secure Authentication:** User login and registration pipeline.
- **Workout Tracking:** Interactive interface for students to access daily training routines.
- **Responsive PWA:** Native-app experience on iOS and Android devices via browser installation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Tentative)

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Design System:** Glassmorphism UI, Dark Mode Aesthetic
- **State Management:** (e.g., React Query / Zustand)
- **Payment Gateway:** (e.g., Stripe / Pagar.me Integration)

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

The application follows a **"Dark Premium"** aesthetic, utilizing a Deep Black/Charcoal background with **Vibrant Teal (#008080)** accents to align with the Bruno Nicolucci brand identity. The interface prioritizes mobile-first usability and high contrast for accessibility.
